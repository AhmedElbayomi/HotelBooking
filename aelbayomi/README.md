The name of the website : Booking rooms


I started with working in the index.html and CSS as i find it the easiest part to work on.
I spent the first period modifying in them trying to umplement te best output from them. After that,
Started implementing in the server.js class with huge help during the last tutorial which was about
assignment help so they helped in the implementation of this class


The hotel booking system features a user friendly interface. Starting with some text whenever you click them directs you to the required spot. Also some details about the hotel. Below it room details. Whenever a user clicks on search and specifying room type, the prices and everything inserted in the rooms.json class will be provided and user will be asked to enter their name and the duration where they want to book the room. If they booked an incorrect time let's say the checkin date is after the checkout it's gonna give an error. I tried providing many links to make it easy to access any required palce in the website.
